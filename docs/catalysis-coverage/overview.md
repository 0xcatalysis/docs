**Catalysis Coverage turns over $20B in restaked collateral**, backed by blue-chip crypto assets like ETH, BTC, and SOL, into a powerful foundation for **programmable risk coverage**. It enables institutional-grade protection for **onchain credit, stablecoins, and structured yield products**.

Catalysis Coverage simplifies the delivery of onchain risk protection by abstracting the complexities of underlying restaking protocols. Through a unified interface, it enables seamless access to restaked collateral for key insurance operations â€” including **policy underwriting, premium collection, claims processing, and capital deployment for payouts**.

**Coming soon.**
