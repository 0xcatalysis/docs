## What is Catalysis?

Catalysis is the first **Onchain Risk Coverage Infrastructure** purpose-built for **Institutional DeFi**. It turns restaked capital into **programmable protection** for **lending markets, stablecoins and structured yield products**.

It is powered by Catalysis Core that provides unified access to **$20B+ of ETH, BTC & SOL-backed economic security**.

### Key Highlights

1. **Programmable, Fully Onchain:** Smart contracts handle dynamic real-time premium pricing, automated underwriting, onchain claims assessment and fast payouts.
2. **Institution-First Design:** Purpose-built for institutions, with legal enforceability and compliance-ready contracts.
3. **$20B+ Underwriting Capacity:** A deep pool of restaked digital assets (BTC, ETH, SOL) backs every policy, unlocking massive cover sizes for institutional-DeFi. 
4. **Simplified Integration UX:** Coverage can be plugged into any protocol with minimal effort, no custom infra needed.

## Simplified Architecture

Catalysis connects multiple moving parts into a single flow.

1. Restakers are the starting point. They deposit digital assets like ETH, BTC, SOL and other assets into restaking protocols like EigenLayer, Symbiotic and Babylon. **Catalysis Core** aggregates that capital & the pooled collateral then forms the raw “capacity” for underwriting risk.

2. Next, **specialist risk curators** launch dedicated coverage vaults called **CoverPools**. These pools draw capacity from Catalysis Core and are designed to underwrite specific types of risk. Each CoverPool can issue multiple policies, tailored to different verticals or institutional needs.

3. Once restakers delegate capacity to a CoverPool, that pool can issue onchain policies to reputed institutional clients such as trading desks, market makers & prime brokerage firms.

4. Premiums flow into the CoverPool and are automatically distributed back to restakers. In the event of a claim, restaked capital is slashed via Catalysis Core and used to provide cover.
