## **AKA - Why Should AVSs Choose Catalysis?**

For AVS teams, Catalysis’ aggregation network offers unparalleled **flexibility** and **efficiency**. We allow for the creation of “*partial AVSs”* that can operate across multiple restaking platforms, enabling, for the first time, market-wide **price discovery** for economic security.

This approach — what we call a “*multi-planetary*” model of shared security — ensures that AVSs aren’t tied to a single protocol. Instead, they can leverage the best features of each platform, optimizing both their security and resiliency.

Catalysis also offers a **flexible framework** for developers, giving them the tools they need to experiment with different security configurations and find what works best for their needs. **We provide the infrastructure; while AVS teams bring the innovation.**

## Summary of Benefits:

1. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: AVSs can dynamically rebalance economic security in real-time across multiple restaking platforms, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
2. **Native Rewards**: AVSs can natively distribute rewards to restakers on any platform where economic security is sourced — eliminating the need for cross-chain transfers or bridging.
3. **Enhanced Buying Power**: By aggregating demand across AVSs, Catalysis enhances buying power, fostering competition among restaking protocols. This leads to better pricing for AVSs.
4. **Unified Interface**: AVS teams can access multiple pools of economic security through a single, unified interface, simplifying the complexity of managing multi-platform operations.
5. **Robust Security**: AVSs built with Catalysis are more resilient against cascading slashings and the migration of restaked assets, offering stronger protection.
6. **Enhanced Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Our Catalyst-SDK streamlines the process of building **universal, robust AVSs**, saving time and reducing duplication of efforts.
