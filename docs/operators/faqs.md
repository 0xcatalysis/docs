# FAQs

1. What are the main responsibilities of node operators in Catalysis Abstraction layer?
2. Say an AVS exists on Eigenlayer (Ethereum) + Jito (Solana). As a NO, do we need to partner with with Eigen & Jito to be able to participate?
3. Would an NO be taking part in the Catalysis Network on two different levels: the SSP layer and the abstraction layer? So basically we would have only like one node on abstraction layer and then. All of the security will be going through this node into AVS at the same time from different protocols, right?
4. Does a NO need to have stake on a new SSP if it wants to run an AVS that exists on the SSP?
5. How does NO role change in case of an AVS they are already validating vs a new AVS that is fresh and doesn't have any economic security via the NO?


Essentially, they are mostly interested in 3 things:
How does this thing work?
What are my action items as NOs?
How does the reward flow to us? AKA, where do we sit in the entire rewards flow? AKA, how do we get paid?AKA, incentives!!
[Vadym] If DevOps process and if incentive system would be working for us. And I don't see any obstacles.
