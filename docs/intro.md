## What is Catalysis Network?

**Catalysis Network is a modular ecosystem** that enables purpose-built financial applications to leverage $20B+ of aggregated restaked collateral to **unlock new capital-efficient markets**.

**Catalysis Network is more than a single protocol**. It is a modular ecosystem where **Catalysis Core** supplies a standardized, cross-protocol security interface and specialized applications build on top.

### Key Highlights

1. **Cross‑Chain by Design**: Aggregates restaked capital from Ethereum, Bitcoin & Solana in a single abstract interface.
2. **Capital Efficiency**: Recycles idle restaked assets into productive collateral while preserving native staking yields.
3. **Institution‑Ready**: Built with transparent slashing logic, risk‑pricing frameworks and compliance‑friendly primitives.

## Ecosystem Components

- **Catalysis Core**  
  The foundational layer that abstracts restaking integrations and exposes **unified staking, slashing and reward primitives**.
- **Catalysis Coverage**  
  A risk-coverage protocol that uses Core’s aggregate restaked collateral to **underwrite credit protection, stablecoins and structured yield products**.
- **Future applications**  
  **Stablecoins, DeFi liquidity layers, RWA markets** and other protocols can plug into Core to leverage shared security without re-implementing restaking logic.

By removing integration overhead, Catalysis gives developers a **single interface** to launch next-generation protocols that inherit deep economic security — **no direct restaking engineering required**.

Get started by exploring the [Catalysis Core](./catalysis-core/overview.md) to understand the foundational architecture.
