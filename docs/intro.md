# Intro to Catalysis

![Catalysis Logo](/img/catalysis.png)

## What is Catalysis?

Catalysis is the first **Security Abstraction Layer** that unlocks **unified access** to **$20B+** ETH, BTC & SOL-backed economic security across restaking protocols.

By abstracting away integration complexity, Catalysis gives developers a **single interface** to seamlessly build next-generation applications powered by restaking, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Why build with Catalysis?

Shared security protocols like EigenLayer, Symbiotic and Satlayer have unlocked a new paradigm for decentralized infrastructure by making it easier to bootstrap decentralized networks (AVSs). However, launching and managing an AVS remains complex and resource-intensive.

Teams must navigate a wide range of challenges. This includes integrating with restaking protocols, configuring slashing and reward mechanisms, managing a node operator set and ensuring cross-restaking protocol composability.

Catalysis eliminates these barriers, making it easier, faster and more cost-efficient to build and operate AVSs.

The key benefits of building an AVS using Catalysis include:

1. **Multi-Ecosystem Security:** Seamlessly integrate restaking protocols across major PoS chains like **Babylon (Bitcoin), Ethereum and Solana**.
2. **Accelerated GTM:** Launch faster with developer-friendly SDKs, clear documentation and up to **80% savings on AVS development costs**.
3. **Unmatched Economic Security:** Tap into **$20B+ in combined TVL** across restaking protocols - ensuring your AVS has the strongest possible security guarantees.
4. **Composability at Scale:** Unlock **composable, interoperable crypto-economic security** across restaking protocols.
5. **No Vendor Lock-In:** Stay flexible with **modular integrations**, enabling your AVS to expand beyond one ecosystem.
6. **Dynamic Security Rebalancing:** Real-time control to allocate and **rebalance security** across restaking protocols with a **single unified interface**.
7. **Resilient Infrastructure:** Spread risk across multiple restaking protocols, ensuring your AVS is **robust and reliable** even in adverse conditions across the restaking ecosystem.

It isn't just about simplifying AVS development - **it’s about unlocking the full potential of shared security**.

## Catalysis Architecture Overview

The Catalysis Network is built on three core components:
1. **Networks** – Decentralized services, protocols and applications (AVSs) that leverage shared security for verification and decentralization.
2. **Node Operators** – Entities that run network software, perform validation tasks and secure them using the Catalysis stack through restaking protocols.
3. **Restaking Protocols** – Also known as shared security protocols, these allow stakers to restake assets (LSTs, ERC-20s, etc.) to provide security for network validation. They function as a marketplace, connecting networks, node operators and stakers.
