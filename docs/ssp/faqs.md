# FAQs

1. **How does a new restaking protocol integrate into Catalysis?**

New restaking protocols integrate with Catalysis through a standardized onboarding process. The Catalysis team collaborates directly with SSP teams to implement required adapters and interfaces, enabling seamless compatibility with the Catalysis Security Abstraction Layer.

2. **Does Catalysis support shared security protocols (SSPs) across all chains?**

Not yet. Catalysis currently supports EVM-based SSPs like [Eigenlayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) and [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/), as well as Cosmos-based protocols like [Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io/) and [Satlayer](https://satlayer.xyz/).

That said, Catalysis is VM-agnostic by designâ€”its flexible architecture allows seamless integration with new restaking protocols as the ecosystem evolves.

3. **What are the benefits for restaking protocols to integrate with Catalysis?**

Restaking protocols integrating with Catalysis benefit from demand aggregation, as Catalysis serves as a distribution channel for Networks seeking economic security. They also enjoy simplified onboarding processes that allow high-quality Networks to integrate more easily, boosting participation. Additionally, the ecosystem growth resulting from streamlined processes attracts more Networks to integrated SSPs.
