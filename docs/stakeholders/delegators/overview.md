# Overview

## **Key Points**

1. Catalysis is a new platform that enables restaked ETH, BTC & SOL to be used as a risk coverage layer.  
2. Catalysis is designed with institutions in mind. **Institution-only access keeps compliance simple & risks limited**.  
3. Early market focus  
   1. **On-chain credit**: Unsecured lending is just $134M today versus $19.8B collateralised. There’s a huge room to grow.  
   2. **Yield-bearing stablecoins**: Supply has jumped to $1B, \~4.5 % of all stablecoins with a CAGR of more than 250%.  
   3. **Tokenised private credit** (RWA) next in line.  
4. Why it matters  
   1. Restakers earn real premium yield on their assets instead of “points.”  
   2. Onchain and legal safeguards target a near-zero loss probability for capital providers.  
   3. Premiums are dynamically priced in real-time; if portfolio risk rises, so does your income stream.  
   4. Institution-grade diligence ensures every coverage client clears KYB and curator due-diligence.

## Interactions with Other Stakeholders

### **Catalysis**

1. Catalysis shares concise risk reports from various coverpool curators that outline suggested base premiums, key risks and other notes.  
2. Restaking curators can (and should) perform their own analysis; their assumptions may differ.  
3. After review, the curator provides its own terms – target premium rate, cover amount to delegate and desired coverage period.

### **Coverage Client**

1. The curator and the client sign a clear legal agreement that permits off‑chain recovery of funds if a claim is paid.  
2. Catalysis coordinates the legal arrangements with the restaking curator (“the underwriter”) & the coverage client (“the buyer”).

## **Risks & Protections**

1. Coverage is exclusively provided to institutional clients; no retail involvement.  
2. Both the Coverpool Curator and the Catalysis team conduct comprehensive due diligence and KYB verification before requesting delegations from restaking curators.  
3. While restaked capital carries some risk of loss, the probability is intentionally maintained at an extremely low level, with continuous risk mitigation efforts.  
4. Premium pricing dynamically adjusts in real-time based on risk assessment. If underwriting risk escalates significantly, premiums increase accordingly.  
5. In exceptional cases of heightened risk, off-chain negotiations may lead to the premature termination of the coverage policy.  
6. Robust legal safeguards are established to facilitate the recovery of restaked assets from Coverage clients.  
   1. An underwriting agreement is executed between the Restaking Vault Curator (or Liquid Restaking Token provider) and the institutional client, with Catalysis serving as a neutral third-party witness.  
   2. In the event of a default, Catalysis initiates legal proceedings on behalf of the Restaking Vault Curator.  
7. Coverage Clients are exclusively accredited institutions with proven reputations and no (limited) prior history of default or bad debt.
