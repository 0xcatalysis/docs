# Delegators

# What are Delegators?

Delegators are entities that delegate slashable restaked capital to CoverPools and act as capacity providers for onchain risk coverage.

They are primarily individual restakers, liquid restaking protocols (LRTs) & restaking vault curators across restaking protocols (Eigenlayer, Symbiotic etc).

# Key Roles

- Restakers act as Capacity Providers: They supply restaked assets that back CoverPools.
- Earns yield + underwriting fees in exchange for bearing loss risk.
- May act directly or via LRTs or DeFi risk curators.
