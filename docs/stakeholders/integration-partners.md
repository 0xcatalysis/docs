# Integration Partners

Integration partners are frontends, aggregators, and routers that help users discover and access **Covered Vaults** through familiar experiences—without forcing an external “buy coverage” workflow.

## Role in the network
Integration partners are the **distribution layer**:
- They surface covered opportunities where users already allocate capital.
- They route deposits into Covered Vaults via standard UX flows.

## What integration partners do
- **Discovery**: list and rank Covered Vaults alongside Base Vault options
- **Routing**: send user deposits to the correct vault (Covered vs Base)
- **UX abstraction**: make coverage feel like a vault attribute, not a separate product

## What they should display clearly
To keep user expectations aligned, integrations should surface:
- Whether a vault is **Covered** or **Base**
- The **premium cost** (or net yield impact) in plain terms
- The coverage scope at a high level (what’s covered / not covered)
- Any limits or conditions that matter (e.g., max coverage, trigger conditions)

## What they are NOT responsible for
- Pricing risk or underwriting (handled by Catalysis + CoverPools)
- Adjudicating claims (defined by coverage terms and executed by the system)
