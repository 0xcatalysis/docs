# Catalyst-SDK

Catalyst SDK is a comprehensive framework for building and managing **Actively Validated Services (AVS)** on the Catalyst network. It can be considered as a _Swiss Army Knife_ to build **Universal AVS**. It enables **plug-and-play** functionality with **full customisability** and provides **standard tooling** to build networks the "right way".

Think of it as "**Cosmos-SDK for building AVS**". It offers built-in **customizable modules** that facilitate rapid development and flexibility to meet each network's specific needs.

It is written in **Go**, so it's both performant and fast.

**NOTE: The Catalyst-SDK is currently in Private Devnet. Private Testnet will launch in July 2025.**

## Core Modules

### 1. Listener Module

The **Listener** module serves as the entry point for task ingestion into the AVS network. It acts as a central hub that receives tasks from various sources and coordinates their distribution across the network.

**Responsibilities:**

- Receive tasks from multiple sources (HTTP APIs, smart contract events, gRPC services, internal modules)
- Validate task structure and integrity before processing
- Broadcast tasks to all network peers via P2P communication
- Forward validated tasks to the consensus engine for leader election and processing
- Handle task timeouts and prevent processing of expired tasks

**Core Flow:**

1. **Task Reception:** Accepts tasks from any input source with validation
2. **Task Broadcasting:** Distributes tasks to all network participants via P2P
3. **Consensus Forwarding:** Submits tasks to consensus engine for coordinated processing

### 2. Consensus Module

The **Consensus Module** coordinates distributed agreement on task execution through a leader-driven consensus mechanism with customizable strategies.

**Core Flow:**

1. **Task Reception:** Receives validated tasks from the listener module
2. **Leader Election:** Executes configurable leader election strategy based on stake, rotation, or custom algorithms
3. **Task Processing:** 
   - If node is elected leader: executes the task and creates signed result
   - If node is not leader: waits for signed result from elected leader
4. **Fallback Handling:** Implements automatic failover with new leader election if current leader fails or times out
5. **Result Distribution:** Broadcasts signed results to the execution module for attestation

**Responsibilities:**

- Manage task lifecycle with deduplication of concurrent attempts
- Execute pluggable leader election strategies (stake-based, round-robin, custom)
- Coordinate task execution with timeout and retry mechanisms
- Ensure signed results are properly distributed across the network
- Handle consensus failures through automatic leader re-election

### 3. Execution Module

The **Execution Module** validates signed results and orchestrates the attestation process across network participants.

**Core Flow:**

1. **Result Validation:** Receives and validates signed results from consensus
2. **Business Logic Execution:** Runs custom AVS logic through TaskHandler interface
3. **Attestation Creation:** Generates cryptographic attestations for validated results
4. **Network Broadcasting:** Distributes attestations to all network peers
5. **Quorum Collection:** Aggregates incoming attestations until threshold is met
6. **Submission Trigger:** Forwards aggregated attestations to submitter when quorum is achieved

**Responsibilities:**

- Validate correctness of signed task results using custom verification logic
- Execute AVS-specific business logic through pluggable TaskHandler interface
- Create and broadcast cryptographic attestations to network peers
- Monitor and collect attestations from other validators
- Aggregate attestations and verify quorum requirements are met
- Handle attestation timeouts and mismatch scenarios with recovery mechanisms

### 4. Submitter Module

The **Submitter Module** handles the final step of task processing by committing results to the blockchain and managing post-processing workflows.

**Core Flow:**

1. **Attestation Reception:** Receives aggregated attestations from execution module
2. **Blockchain Submission:** Submits attestations to TaskManager smart contracts
3. **Transaction Management:** Handles gas estimation, transaction broadcasting, and confirmation
4. **Retry Logic:** Implements exponential backoff for failed submissions
5. **Post-Processing:** Executes custom callbacks and triggers reward distribution

**Responsibilities:**

- Submit aggregated attestation sets to on-chain TaskManager contracts
- Support both ECDSA and BLS signature schemes for different blockchain requirements
- Manage transaction lifecycle with proper gas handling and confirmation monitoring
- Implement robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for network issues
- Handle concurrent submissions through goroutine-based processing
- Execute post-submission logic including rewards distribution and logging
