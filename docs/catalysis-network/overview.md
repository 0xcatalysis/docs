## What is Catalysis Network?

Catalysis is the first **Security Abstraction Layer** that unlocks **Unified Access** to **$20B+** ETH, BTC & SOL-backed economic security across restaking protocols.

By abstracting away integration complexity, Catalysis gives developers a **single interface** to seamlessly build next-generation applications powered by restaking, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
