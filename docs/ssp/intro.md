# Introduction

## What is a Shared Security Protocol?

Shared Security Protocols (or Restaking Protocols) create a **marketplace for economic security**, enabling decentralized networks to source security from stakers.

They act as a coordination layer connecting:
- **Stakers** → Provide economic security by delegating assets and maximizing returns.
- **Node Operators** → Run network infrastructure and expand into high-value decentralized services.
- **Networks** → Acquire security guarantees from restaked assets.

## Why should Shared Security Protocols work with Catalysis?

Catalysis brings significant advantages to **shared security protocols (SSPs)** by aggregating demand and acting as a distribution channel, creating a more competitive and fair environment for these platforms. One of the key features Catalysis unlocks is **leveling the playing field** for restaking protocols, allowing them to compete on the strength and efficiency — in terms of both cost and performance — of their offerings. This also opens us opportunities for newer protocols to gain traction.

By simplifying the onboarding process for Networks, Catalysis encourages more projects to deploy as Networks, driving overall ecosystem growth. As more Networks are attracted to these platforms, it creates a **win-win situation** where both Network teams and SSPs benefit from increased participation.

In addition to driving adoption, Catalysis helps SSPs offer **better features and more reliable economic security**, making their platforms more appealing to Networks seeking robust solutions. The influx of high-quality Networks further enhances the robustness and value of these protocols, fostering a vibrant, **competitive ecosystem** for the future.

## Summary of Benefits

- **Demand Aggregation**: Catalysis acts as a distribution channel, aggregating demand for economic security from Networks.
- **Level Playing Field**: Provides equal opportunities for all restaking protocols to compete based on features, cost, and performance.
- **Streamlined Onboarding**: Simplifies the process for Networks to deploy, driving ecosystem growth.
- **Enhanced Features**: Encourages SSPs to offer better features and more reliable economic security.
- **Attracting Networks**: Increases participation by enabling high-quality Networks to join the ecosystem.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Fosters a vibrant and competitive environment for shared security protocols.
