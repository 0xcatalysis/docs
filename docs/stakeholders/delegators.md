# Delegators

Delegators supply the capital that backs Catalysis CoverPools. In return, they earn underwriting fees (premiums) while bearing defined loss risk.

## What Delegators do
- Provide underwriting capacity by delegating restaked assets to Catalysis-aligned vaults / operators.
- Earn yield + underwriting fees as long as no covered loss event triggers payouts.
- Participate directly or via LRTs, curators, or restaking vault managers.

## What Delegators care about
- **Risk**: What losses are covered, how payouts happen, and worst-case exposure.
- **Return**: Premium rate, utilization, and reward accounting.
- **Transparency**: Onchain accounting, claim criteria, and payout mechanics.

## How Delegators interact with Catalysis
- Delegated restaked capital is structured into **CoverPools**.
- CoverPools underwrite **Covered Vaults** and receive premium flows.
- If a covered loss event occurs, CoverPools pay out according to the coverage contract.
