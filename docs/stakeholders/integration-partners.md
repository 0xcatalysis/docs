# Integration Partners

Integration partners are distribution layers (frontends, aggregators, routers) that surface Covered Vaults to users and make participation seamless.

## What integration partners do
- Surface Covered Vaults to LPs via familiar UX (e.g., Superform, Jumper Earn).
- Route deposits/withdrawals into Covered Vaults without an external coverage workflow.
- Provide discovery, allocation, and user onboarding for covered vault opportunities.

## Why they matter
- Expand distribution and make covered vaults easy to access.
- Preserve a single “vault deposit” flow while still enabling protection.

## Typical integration
- Frontend discovery → deposit routing → Covered Vault interaction → onchain accounting.
