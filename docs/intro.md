## What is Catalysis Network?

**Catalysis Network** is the first **Security Abstraction Layer** that unlocks **Unified Access to $20B+ ETH, BTC & SOL-backed Economic Security** across leading restaking protocols on Ethereum, Bitcoin & Solana.

By abstracting away integration complexity, Catalysis gives developers a **single interface** to seamlessly build next-generation applications powered by restaking, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
