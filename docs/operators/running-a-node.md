# Running a Node

This section will cover the steps to run a node for our upcoming testnet. If you are interested in participating as a node operator in the testnet, please send a DM [here](https://x.com/xenowits).

**Coming soon.**

## How does it work?

The following is the view from the perspective of a node operator running an AVS built using Catalysis.

- The AVS is sourcing economic security across EigenLayer, Symbiotic, Satlayer and Jito.
- Each node operator runs a single instance of a Catalysis node client software.
