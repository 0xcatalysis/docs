# Introduction

Node operators are the backbone of the Catalysis Network. They are the "engine" that runs the SSN infrastructure and provide economic security to the network.

Catalysis offers substantial advantages for node operators by simplifying the management of SSN infrastructure across multiple restaking platforms. With the **Catalyst-CLI** tool, operators can seamlessly manage their SSN setups from a single interface. This **unified solution** eliminates the need to run separate infrastructure for each platform, instead offering a single node setup that saves both time and effort.

A key benefit of Catalysis is the **significant reduction in DevOps engineering expenses**. This not only minimizes development overhead but also ensures that node operators can scale their SSN management to handle thousands of services with minimal effort.

Moreover, Catalysis empowers node operators of all sizes to participate in running SSN infrastructure, not just the larger ones. This inclusion contributes to the **decentralization of the node operator set,** addressing a [growing problem](https://restake.watch/) in the restaking ecosystem.

## Advantages

- **Simplified Management**: Use the Catalyst-CLI tool to manage SSN infrastructure across multiple restaking platforms from a single interface.
- **Unified Node Setup**: Operate a single node setup for all platforms, reducing the need for multiple infrastructure setups.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Save on DevOps expenses by avoiding the need for custom tooling for each restaking platform.
- **Scalability**: Easily manage thousands of SSNs with minimal overhead.
- **Reliability**: SSNs built with Catalyst-SDK minimize technical issues like debugging errors and key management.
- **Decentralization**: Enable smaller node operators to participate, promoting a more decentralized ecosystem.
- **Focus on Performance**: Spend less time on operations and more on delivering secure and efficient infrastructure.
