**Catalysis Coverage is a programmable risk coverage protocol purpose-built for institutions**. It transforms $20B+ in restaked capital into active protection across **onchain credit, stablecoins, structured yield products & real-world risks.**

Catalysis Coverage streamlines onchain risk protection by abstracting away the complexities of underlying restaking protocols. Through a unified interface, institutions gain seamless access to restaked capital for key operations â€” **from policy underwriting and premium collection to claims processing and payout execution.**
