# FAQs

1. **What are the prerequisites for a Node Operator to join the Catalysis Network?**

There are no prerequisites. If you’re already running a node for a network/SSN on any restaking protocol (EigenLayer, Jito, SatLayer, etc.), you’re automatically part of the Catalysis Network.

2. **What are the main responsibilities of a Node Operator in the Catalysis Abstraction layer?**

You need to run a couple of commands to register your node with the Catalysis Network. And then you just run your node as you normally would. Except, now you'll be running the Catalysis-Powered SSN node software.

Register your node with the Catalysis Network using a few simple commands, and then continue operating it as usual. Catalysis seamlessly integrates SSN security, **so you only need to run the SSN node software once, regardless of how many restaking protocols the SSN spans**. No additional infrastructure overhead.

3. **Say an SSN exists on Eigenlayer (Ethereum) + Satlayer (Babylon). As a Node Operator, do we need to partner with Eigenlayer and Satlayer to be able to participate?**

No, you don’t need to partner with any restaking protocol directly. However, you do need to partner with LRTs/Vault curators to get delegations on Eigenlayer and Satlayer. Catalysis abstracts these integrations, allowing you to run SSNs across multiple restaking protocols without individual agreements.

4. **Does a Node Operator participate at two levels - both the shared security protocol (SSP) layer and the abstraction layer?**

No, you only participate at one level: the Catalysis Abstraction Layer. You run one node per SSN. And Catalysis seamlessly manages security delegation across multiple SSPs.

5. **If a Node Operator wants to run an SSN on a new Shared Security Protocol (SSP), do they need stake in that SSP?**

Yes, node operators must have economic security delegation on the SSP to participate. For example, if you want to run an SSN on Symbiotic, you need delegated security from Symbiotic vaults.

6. **How are Rewards distributed to Node Operators?**

Rewards are distributed directly by the SSPs. If you’re running a Catalysis-Powered SSN (say $100M) secured by EigenLayer ($50M) + Symbiotic ($50M), you’ll receive separate payouts from both EigenLayer and Symbiotic based on your stake and participation.

7. **Do we need to partner with LRTs to run networks on a Shared Security Protocol (SSP)?**

No, you don’t need to partner with LRTs directly. Catalysis partners with top LRTs and vault curators across SSPs, allowing you to seamlessly run Networks without separate LRT agreements.

However, if you already have LRT partnerships, it can streamline delegation and integration, making the process even smoother.
