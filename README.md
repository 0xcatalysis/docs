# Overview

Catalysis is the first **Security Abstraction Layer** that unlocks unified access to $20B+ ETH, BTC & SOL-backed economic security across restaking protocols. Our goal is to simplify the process of building and managing SSNs by providing a seamless, unified solution for SSN developers and node operators.

This repository hosts documentation and guides for SSNs & Node operators looking to build on Catalysis.
