## What is Catalysis Network?

**Catalysis Network** is the first **Security Abstraction Layer** that unlocks **Unified Access to $20B+ ETH, BTC & SOL-backed Economic Security** across leading restaking protocols on Ethereum, Bitcoin & Solana.

Catalysis Network is more than a single protocol. It is a modular ecosystem where **Catalysis Core** supplies a standardized, cross-protocol security interface and specialized applications build on top.

- **Catalysis Core**  
  The foundational layer that abstracts restaking integrations and exposes **unified staking, slashing and reward primitives**.
- **Catalysis Coverage**  
  A risk-coverage protocol that uses Core’s aggregate restaked collateral to **underwrite credit protection, stablecoins and structured yield products**.
- **Future applications**  
  **Stablecoins, DeFi liquidity layers, RWA markets** and other protocols can plug into Core to leverage shared security without re-implementing restaking logic.

By removing integration overhead, Catalysis gives developers a **single interface** to launch next-generation protocols that inherit deep economic security — **no direct restaking engineering required**.
